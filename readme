The code language I have chosen is python with version 3 as it looked more like data retrieval task. I am not very specific to any language.
 The code containing file is named as 'query.py' and it can be run by any ide if your device has python 3 installed .
 I specifically used pycharm for this assignment.
 Please remember to install pip packages and import requests before running this assignment.
 Git contains my virtual environment named as venv if required to run query.py
 If you are trying to run it from docker file, Please keep the docker file named 'my_new_docker_build' and 'query' in same folder.
 I created docker image using windows , but it can be done by using any operating system so download docker in your device and run it .
 The commands I used are: docker build -f my_new_docker_build .
 After creating image a number is generated something like '1a6fefkm5346mg' , so this number is image number and it contains entire libraries and whatever is required to run python code.
  Then run the command docker run [image_name]
  The code will run with first 2 tasks dont require any user input , third require the year. so enter the year to further see the output.
  I am not able to create kubern.yaml file.. Working on it and will upload if I am able to create it.
